# GameStore
An e-store, cross-platform, desktop application where the user can create an account and purchase digital games. Developed with the NetBeans IDE 8.2 using JavaFX. The application runs locally in a XAMPP enviroment. The administration part is handled by the phpMyAdmin tool for the project's database management. The admin can add, delete and update records that represent users, products and orders in the database. <br /> <br />
*Note: When a new user registers and enters for the first time the Game Store, an amount of 50,00â‚¬ is added to his account due to the complexity of embedding an entire banking system. This project has mostly educational nature as it was also my thesis for the Informatics Engineering department.*
